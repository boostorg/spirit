# ï»¿spirit::get_rhs-branch

## Purpose

The code in this branch should solve the problems enumerated
in the next section.  The code solving each problem is
delimited by "Guard" macros of the form:

  `BOOST_SPIRIT_X3_EXPERIMENTAL_<tail>`

where `<tail>` is one of:

  * `GET_RHS_NS`
  * `GET_RHS_CRTP`
  * `ATTR_XFORM_IN_RULE`
  
These "Guard" macros for a particular problem can be switched 
on or off by setting the values of `0` (for off) or `1` (for
one).  This allows:

  * Reviewers to clearly see which code is intended to solve
    which problem.

  * Future users, if they encounter problems with code, to
    revert back to existing `spirit` code.
    
    *HOWEVER*, that last is not *entirely* true in the case
     of the `ATTR_XFORM_IN_RULE` macro.  In this case, in
     order to avoid code duplication, a new function,
     `rule_attr_transform_f` was created, which abstracts
     parts of the code in the existing `spirit` code in the
     `call_rule_defintion` function in
     `nonterminal/detail/rule.hpp`.
     
In each section below, there's a listing of:

  * The "Guard" macro which switches the change on or off.
  
  * The problem the change solves.
  
  * An abstract of how the problem was solved.
  
  * Interest in solution.  This includes references to the
    mailing list posts where the problem is reported or
    discussed.
    
  * test code links
  
### Problems solved:

#### Excessive compile times when BOOST_SPIRIT_DEFINE not used.
  * Guard Macro: BOOST_SPIRIT_X3_EXPERIMENTAL_GET_RHS_NS
  * Problem:
      The attachment to:
      
      [rule2rhs-context-complexity](https://sourceforge.net/p/spirit/mailman/message/35355552/)
      
    describes the problem, in particular the part which
    says:
      
      >To summarize, if BOOST_SPIRIT_DEFINE method were the only
      >one allowed, then that would allow several lines of code to
      >be removed from detail/rule.hpp.  In particular, there would
      >be no need for: make_rule_context since there would be no
      >need to change the context.  Also, with this method, the
      >context is not modified, leading, probably, to some
      >compile-time as well as run-time speedup. 

    In particular, the part about `make_rule_context`.
    Calls to that function are the cause of the excessive
    compile times mentioned in the posts under the `Interest
    in solution` item below.
        
  * get_rhs solution.
  
    Get_rhs simply removes the connection between rhs and
    lhs in the context by removing use of the
    `make_rule_context` function, leaving only the
    `BOOST_SPIRIT_DEFINE` method for connecting the rules
    rhs with it's lhs.
    
      * Pro's
      
        Compile time does not increase nearly as fast.
        
      * Con's
      
        Breaks some existing code.

      This Makefile target benchmarks a *prototype* of the
      `get_rhs` code.  This prototype code does not use
      attributes (since the purpose is to measure
      *compile-time* of *grammar recursion* implementation,
      not how *attribute processing* affects *compile-time*)
      and only has the minimum grammar operators needed to
      generate the benchmark grammar.  The results:
      
      [bench_results][bench_ref]
        
      clearly show that as the number of rules increases,
      the compile time, using the current `spirit` method
      (designated with the `RULE2RHS_CTX_LIST` tag in the
      results) for connecting the rhs to lhs of a
      production, gets much slower relative to *all* the
      other methods.

      are in the comments in:

#### x3 like qi-better encapsulaton

  * Guard Macro: BOOST_SPIRIT_X3_EXPERIMENTAL_GET_RHS_CRTP
  * Problem:
      Using BOOST_SPIRIT_DEFINE requires rule definitions in
      some namespace.  OTOH, Qi encapsulates rule
      definitions in class.  x3 should be more like qi to
      enable better grammar encapsulation.
      
  * get_rhs solution.
  
    Get_rhs solves this problem using the
    [crtp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern#General_form)
    design pattern.  The base class, `gram_base`, of this
    pattern contains a nested template class, `rule_b`,
    which plays a role similar to that of the `rule`
    template class in the existing `spirit` code.  The base
    class also has a default `get_rhs` template function
    which plays a role similar to that of the default
    `parse_rule` function in the existing `spirit` code in
    `nonterminal/rule.hpp`.
    
    The derived class uses the `BOOST_SPIRIT_DEFINE_CRTP`
    macro to generate a `get_rhs` member function which
    overrides the default `get_rhs` member function in the
    base class for a specific `rule_b<...>::id`, much the
    way `parse_rule` function generated by the
    `BOOST_SPIRIT_DEFINE` macro overrides the default
    `parse_rule` function defined near the top of
    `nonterminal/rule.hpp`.

    The benchmark results, [bench_results][bench_ref], shows
    this method, the one with the `RULE2RHS_GET_RHS_CRTP`
    tag, is *marginally* slower than the fasted method.
            
#### BOOST_SPIRIT_INSTANTIATE link error

  * Guard Macro: BOOST_SPIRIT_X3_EXPERIMENTAL_ATTR_XFORM_IN_RULE
  * Problem:
  
      Separate compilation of grammar rules using the
      `BOOST_SPIRIT_INSTANTIATE` macro, under some
      circumstances( maybe when attribute is *not* of type
      unused_type *and* there's no semantic action?) leads
      to link error.
      
      The problem occurs because the
      `BOOST_SPIRIT_INSTANTIATE` macro generates a
      `parse_rule` instantiation requiring a specific type,
      `rule_type::attribute_type`, for the rule's attribute
      argument. In contrast, the `rule<ID,Attribute>::parse`
      function takes an arugment `ActualAttribute& attr` and
      passes that to the `parse_rule` function.  When
      `Attribute != ActualAttribute`, the link error occurs.

  * Method of solution.
  
    In the current `spirit` method, the `ActualAttribute&
    attr` passed to the `parse_rule` function called by
    `rule<ID,Attribute>::parse` is transformed, after a few
    intervening function calls, into `Attribute& _attr` by
    the `rule_attr_transform_f` call within the:
    
      > `detail::rule_parser<Attribute,ID>::call_rule_definition` 

    function in `nonterminal/detail/rule.hpp`.
    
    The link problem is solved by moving the
    `rule_attr_transform_f` to the `rule<...>::parse
    function just before the call to `parse_rule`.  However,
    without this transformation called from within,
    indirectly, `rule_definition<...>::parse`, using an
    instance of `rule_definition<...>` on the rhs of a
    grammar expression would result in no attribute
    transformation, which of course would be invalid.  But
    the transformation cannot be put in
    `rule_definition<...>::parse` because would duplicate
    the transformation in `rule<...>::parse.  The solution
    is to have `parse_rule` new function
    `rule_definition<...>::parse_na_xform` which does no
    attribute transform.
