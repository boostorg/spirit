- Fixed a bug while expanding macros without any definition part (empty macros)

Tue Feb 25 21:44:19     2003
- Fixed the warnings emitted by gcc -Wall.
- Fixed a bug in the cpp grammar, which causes to failing the recognition of 
  certain preprocessor directives if at the end of this directive were placed 
  a C++ comment.
- Simplified and extended the insertiom of whitespace tokens at places, where
  otherwise two adjacent tokens would form a new different token, if 
  retokenized.

Mon Feb 24 19:13:46     2003
- defined() functionality was broken
- added missing typename keywords
- added missing using namespace statements, where appropriate
- added a warning, when a predefined macro is to be undefined
- removed the 'compile in C mode' hack for the re2c generated lexer (VC7.1 
  (final beta) is not able to compile it with optimizations switched on 
  anyway :( )
- compiled with gcc 3.2 and Intel V7.0 (20030129Z)

  
Sun Feb 23 23:39:33  2003
- Fixed a couple of 'missing typename' bugs (thanks to Martin Wille)
- Added code to insert whitespace at places, where otherwise two adjacent 
  tokens would form a new different token, if retokenized.
- Fixed a severe macro expansion bug.
- Added the handling of invalid or not allowed universal character values 
  inside of string literals and character literals.

Sat Feb 22 20:52:06  2003
- Bumped version to 0.9.0
- Added test for invalid or not allowed universal character values (see
  C++ Standard 2.2.2 [lex.charset] and Annex E)
- Fixed a bug with newlines between a macro name and the opening paranthesis 
  during the macro expansion and a bug with newlines inside the parameter list
  during the macro expansion.
- Added the following predefined macros:
    __SPIRIT_PP__
        expands to the version number of the pp-iterator lib (i.e. 0x0090 for 
        V0.9.0)
    __SPIRIT_PP_VERSION__
        expands to the full version number of the pp-iterator lib (i.e.
        0x00900436 for V0.9.0.436)
    __SPIRIT_PP_VERSION_STR__
        expands to the full version string of the pp-iterator lib (i.e. 
        "0.9.0.436")
  
Fri Feb 21 22:09:04  2003 (feature complete!)
- Allowed to optionally compile the Re2c generated lexer in 'C' mode, because 
  at least the VC7.1 (final beta) compiler has problems to compile it in 'C++'
  mode with optimizations switch on
- Implemented #error and #warning (optional) directives (C++ standard 16.5). 
  Additionally there are now allowed the following preprocessor configuration 
  constants:
    CPP_PREPROCESS_ERROR_MESSAGE_BODY
        if defined, preprocesses the message body of #error and #warning  
        directives to allow for better diagnostics.
    CPP_SUPPORT_WARNING_DIRECTIVE
        if defined, then the #warning directive will be recognized such, that
        a warning with the given message will be issued
- Adjusted the error handling for the Re2c generated C++ lexer, so that any
  error inside the lexer is now propagated as an cpplexer_exception.
- Implemented the #line directive (C++ standard 16.4)
- Implemented #pragma directive (C++ standard 16.6)
  Additionally there are now allowed the following preprocessor configuration 
  constants:
    CPP_RETURN_PRAGMA_DIRECTIVES
        if defined, then the whole pragma directive is returned as a token
        sequence to the caller, if not defined the whole pragma directive is 
        skipped
    CPP_PREPROCESS_PRAGMA_BODY
        if defined, then the #pragma body will be preprocessed 
- Implemented #include directive with macro arguments (C++ standard 16.2.4)
- Made the namespace structure finer granulated to leave only the main 
  interface classes in the main namespace cpp. All other classes are moved into
  subnamespaces to reflect the logical dependencies
- Reorganized the public interface of the context<> template class, made all
  non relevant functions into the protected.
- Implemented predefinded macros (__LINE__ et.al.) (C++ standard 16.8)
- Further documentation work
  
Wed Feb 19 23:44:47  2003
- Corrected a lot of bugs in the macro expansion engine, which now should be 
  conformant to the C++ standard.
- # (null) directive (C++ standard 16.7)

Sun Feb 16 08:40:38  2003
- Added a macro expansion engine which expands macros with arguments 
  C++ standard 16.3 [cpp.replace]
- Added a new sample: cpp_tokens. This sample preprocesses a given file and
  prints out the string representations of all tokens returned from the pp 
  iterator
- Added documentation (to be continued!)
- Added a couple of small test files to test elementary functionality
  (the tests mainly were contributed by Paul Mensonides)
- The main cpp sample is now a simple preprocessor driver program, which 
  outputs the string representation of the preprocessed input stream. Use 
  cpp --help to get a hint, how to use it.
- Fixed a bug in the preprocessor grammar which failed to recognize a pp 
  statement, if there was a C++ comment at the end of the line
- Added '#' operator (C++ standard 16.3.2) [cpp.stringize]
- Fixed a bug in the slex based C++ lexer to handle the concatination 
  characters correctly ('\\' followed by a '\n')

Sun Feb  9 23:01:00  2003
- Improved error handling for #if et.al.
- Fixed a pair of lexer errors
- Implemented the #if/#elif statements, the sample now contains a complete C++ 
  expression evaluation engine (for the calculation of the outcome of the 
  #if/#elif statement conditions)
- Implemented macro replacement (with parameters)
- Implemented the '##' [cpp.concat] operator
- Implemented the defined() [cpp.cond] operator

Sun Feb  2 23:28:24  2003
- Implemented the  #define, #undef, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else and #endif 
  statements
- Added optional parse tree output as xml stream (controlled through the config
  pp constant CPP_DUMP_PARSE_TREE)

Fri Jan 31 21:30:55  2003
- Fixed different minor issues and a border case (#include statement at the 
  last line of a included file)

Wed Jan 29 21:13:32  2003
- Fixed exception handling to report the correct error position
- Fixed another bug in the stream position calculation scheme
- Added a more elaborate sample 'list_includes' which lists the dependency
  information for a given source file (see test/list_includes/readme.txt).

Sat Jan 18 22:01:03  2003
- Fixed a bug in the stream position calculation scheme
- Made cpp::exceptions more standard conformant (added 'throw()' at appropriate 
  places)
- Overall housekeeping :-)

Wed Jan 15 21:54:20  2003
Changes since project start (still 0.5.0)
- Added #include <...> and #include "..." functionality
- pp directives are now generally recognized 
- Decoupled the C++ lexers and the pp grammar to separate compilation
  units (optionally) to speed up compilation (a lot!)

Thu Jan  2 12:39:30  2003
A completely new version 0.5.0 of the C preprocessor was startet. It's a 
complete rewrite of the existing code base. The main differences are:
- The preprocessor is now implemented as an iterator, which returns the 
  current preprocessed token from the input stream.
- The preprocessing of include files isn't implemented through recursion
  anymore. This follows directly from the first change. As a result of this
  change the internal error handling is simplified.
- The C preprocessor iterator itself is feeded by a new unified C++ lexer 
  iterator. BTW, this C++ lexer iterator could be used standalone and is not 
  tied to the C preprocessor. There are two different C++ lexers implemented 
  now, which are functionally completely identical. These expose a similar
  interface, so the C preprocessor could be used with both of them.
- The C++ lexers integrated into the C preprocessor by now are:
    Slex:   A spirit based table driven regular expression lexer (the slex 
            engine originally was written by Dan Nuffer and is available as a
            separate Spirit sample).
    Re2c:   A C++ lexer generated with the help of the re2c tool. This C++
            lexer was written as a sample by Dan Nuffer too.
  It isn't hard to plug in additional different C++ lexers. There are plans to
  integrate a third one written by Juan Carlos Arevalo-Baeza, which is 
  available as a Spirit sample.

Tue Feb 12 22:29:50  2002
Changes from 0.2.3 to 0.2.4:
- Moved XML dumping functions to the main Spirit directory
- Fixed operator '##', it was not correctly implemented somehow :-(

Sun Feb 10 21:07:19  2002
Changes from 0.2.2 to 0.2.3:
- Implemented concatenation operator '##' (cpp.concat)
- Removed defined() functionality for Intel compiler (it ICE's) until this 
  issue is resolved
- Separated code for dumping a parsetree to XML for inclusion in the main
  Spirit headers

Thu Jan 17 23:51:21  2002
Changes from 0.2.1 to 0.2.2:
- Fixes to compile with gcc 2.95.2 and gcc 3.0.2 (thanks Dan Nuffer)
- Reformatted the grammars to conform to a single formatting guideline
- Assigned explicit rule_id's to the rules of cpp_grammar, so that the 
  access code to the embedded definition class is not needed anymore
- Fixed a remaining const problem

Tue Jan 15 23:40:40  2002
Changes from 0.2.0 to 0.2.1:
- Corrected handling of defined() operator
- In preprocessing conditionals undefined identifiers now correctly
  replaced by '0'
- Fixed several const problems
- Added parse_node_iterator for traversing one node in a parse_tree
  without going deeper down the hierarchy than one level (this is useful,
  if all inspected tokens arranged along a single node in the parse tree.
  The main difference to the parse_tree_iterator is, that the underlying
  iterator generally can be adjusted correctly after advancing the attached
  parse_node_iterator
- Fixed a problem with gcc 2.95.2, which doesn't have a <sstream> header
- Prepared usage of slex for lexer states

Sun Jan 13 10:21:16  2002
Changes from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0:
- Added operator 'defined()'
- Added directive '#warning'
- Corrected error reporting
- Added command line option -I- for finer control of the searched include
  directories (-I and -I- should now work as in gcc, see readme.html for 
  more info)
- Corrected conditional preprocessing (should be fully functional now)
- Fixed existing codebase for changes made in parse tree support
- Moved parse tree utility functions to a separate header (prepaired for 
  inclusion to the Spirit main library)
